// Task 2: Create Route Components
//     Create four new components: Home, BrowseCharacters, CharacterDetails, and Comics. The home & comic components can be empty for now, with just a simple return statement and you can reuse your browse & detail components from the previous assignment.

const Comics = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h2>Comics</h2>
            <p>This component is under construction. Check back later!</p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Comics;
